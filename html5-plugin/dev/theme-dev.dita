 <title>Theme Development</title>
 <shortdesc>The theme mechanism is a preprocessing and packaging mechanism which works on CSS and
  javascripts.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  
  <p>The theme mechanism does not force any particular architectural decision for css and
   javascripts. It allows you:
   <ul>
    <li>to organize the librairies of your choice in the way you want;</li>
    <li>to package them in the way you want; and</li>
    <li>to provide this information to the HTML5 plugin so it can render them properly.</li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p>The plugin provide an optional javascript object, named <apiname>d4p</apiname> which allows to pass some information from the ant code, xsl code or dita files code to the javascript code.</p>
